# UFO Website

## Overview

The goal of this project was to create a functioning website that would allow the end user to search and filter through
a larghe data set of UFO sightings and have it displayed in a table for easy consumption by the user. The website was built using
Bootstrap 4 framework, using a CSS style sheet and running the script to filter our data set using JavaScript.

## Results

When an indiviual first visits the website, all filtered searches are cleared and the table shows every single UFO sighting
data point in the database.

When the user would like to make the UFO sightings more managable to look at or want to find specific sightings, they can
chose to from five different filter options.

As the user enters certain criteria into the search filters, the table automatically updates with the information they are
looking for. Below will be three pictures depicting how the table updates as you add filters.

First, we will fiter by selecting a specific date, 1/1/2010.
